# MathQuest
 Race against the clock to solve simple math problems.

Written in PyGame. Currently there are three different kinds of monsters: the Subtraction Skeleton, the Multiplication Mushroom, and the Addition Goblin.

Still very much a work in progress. Next on the list is animating the sprites to where the player attacks the monster when a correct answer is selected and adding sound.
